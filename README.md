## About the Data

### Data Source

This project utilizes television product data from the following sources:
- **Manufacturer Specifications**: Official technical specifications obtained from manufacturer websites and product documentation
- **Retail Price Data**: Current pricing information aggregated from major electronics retailers
- **Product Reviews**: Consumer review summaries from verified purchase platforms
- **Market Research**: Industry reports and market analysis data from electronics industry publications

**Collection Methods**: Data is collected through automated web scraping (where permitted), API integrations with retail partners, and manual verification from official sources.

**Data Currency**: Product information is updated weekly, pricing data is refreshed daily, and review summaries are updated monthly.

### Data Processing

Our data processing pipeline follows established data governance principles:

**Data Quality Assurance**:
- Automated validation of technical specifications against manufacturer standards
- Cross-verification of pricing data across multiple retail sources
- Standardization of product categories and features for consistent comparison
- Removal of duplicate or incomplete product entries

**Data Transformation**:
- Normalization of pricing data across different currencies and regions  
- Standardization of technical specifications using industry-standard units
- Aggregation of review scores using weighted averages
- Classification of products into comparable categories (screen size, technology type, etc.)

**Data Documentation**: All processing steps are logged with timestamps, source attribution, and transformation details maintained for transparency.

### Privacy

This project adheres to privacy-by-design principles:

**User Data Collection**:
- **No Personal Identification**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or other personally identifiable information (PII)
- **Local Storage Only**: User preferences and comparison selections are stored locally in browser storage and never transmitted to servers
- **Anonymous Analytics**: Basic usage statistics (page views, popular products) may be collected using privacy-focused analytics that do not track individuals

**Third-Party Data**:
- All manufacturer and retailer data is obtained through legitimate channels with respect for their terms of service
- No consumer personal information from external sources is stored or processed
- Compliance with applicable privacy regulations (GDPR for EU users, CCPA for California users)

**Data Minimization**: Only data necessary for product comparison functionality is collected and processed.

### Accuracy and Limitations

**Data Accuracy**:
- Product specifications are sourced from official manufacturer documentation but may not reflect the most recent updates
- Pricing information reflects recent market data but is subject to real-time changes and regional variations
- Review summaries represent aggregated consumer opinions and may not reflect individual experiences

**Known Limitations**:
- Product availability varies by region and is not guaranteed to be current
- Some technical specifications may be simplified for comparison purposes
- Pricing does not include taxes, shipping, or promotional discounts that may vary by location
- Review data may be subject to selection bias based on the demographics of review platform users
- Data refresh cycles mean information may lag behind rapid market changes by up to 24-48 hours

**Quality Assurance**: Regular audits are conducted to identify and correct data discrepancies, with error reporting mechanisms available to users.

### Ethics

Our approach to data ethics is guided by principles of fairness, transparency, and consumer benefit:

**Ethical Data Use**:
- All data is used solely to provide informational value to consumers making purchasing decisions
- No manipulation of data to favor particular brands or retailers
- Transparent methodology for product rankings and comparisons
- Equal treatment of all manufacturers and products in data presentation

**Consumer Protection**:
- Clear disclosure of data sources and limitations
- No hidden affiliations that could bias product recommendations  
- Accessibility features implemented to serve users with diverse needs
- Protection of user privacy as a fundamental right
